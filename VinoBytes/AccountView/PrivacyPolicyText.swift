    Welcome to VinoBytes, an educational wine app. Your privacy is important to us. This Privacy Policy outlines how we collect, use, and protect your information.
    """,
    "2. Data Collection": """
    VinoBytes collects minimal personal data. Most of the data is stored locally on your device and synchronized with your iCloud account using Apple’s CloudKit services. The app does not store extensive personal information on our servers. However, interactions with the AI functionality provided by OpenAI may involve data being processed by OpenAI.
    """,
    "3. Data Usage": """
    The data collected is used solely to enhance your experience with the app. We do not sell or share your personal data with third parties except as required to operate the app or comply with legal obligations.

    "4. Interaction with OpenAI": """
    When using AI functionalities, your interactions may be sent to OpenAI for processing. This includes any text input provided for generating responses. OpenAI’s handling of this data is governed by their Privacy Policy. Specifically, OpenAI may:

    • Retain data for up to 30 days for the purpose of providing and improving their services and identifying abuse.

    "5.  Interaction with iCloud and CloudKit": """
    VinoBytes utilizes Apple’s iCloud services, specifically CloudKit, to synchronize your data across multiple devices. This ensures that your wines, flashcards, and conversation history are consistently available wherever you use the app.
    
    Data Synchronization:
    
    • Storage: Your data is stored both locally on your device and securely in iCloud. This dual storage mechanism allows for seamless access and backup.
    • Syncing: Any changes made to your data on one device are automatically synced to iCloud and reflected on your other devices connected to the same Apple ID.
    
    Data Deletion and Reset:
    
    • Local and iCloud Data Removal: When you choose to reset or delete your data through the account settings in VinoBytes, the app removes the corresponding data from both your device and iCloud. This ensures that your information is completely erased and cannot be recovered from either storage location.
    
    Reset Options:

    • Reset My Wines: Deletes all wine entries from your device and iCloud.
    • Reset Flashcard Progress: Resets all flashcard progress, setting box numbers to 1 and clearing review dates both locally and in iCloud.
    • Reset Vino Chat Conversation History: Deletes all conversation history from your device and iCloud.
    
    These actions are irreversible and will result in the permanent loss of the respective data.
    
    • User-Controlled Deletion: You have full control over your data. Through the account settings, you can delete your wines, reset flashcard progress, or clear your conversation history. These actions will synchronize across all your devices and remove the data from your device and your iCloud.

    Security Measures:
    
    • Encryption: Data stored in iCloud is protected using industry-standard encryption methods. This ensures that your information remains secure both during transmission and while stored.
    • Access Controls: Only you have access to your iCloud data associated with VinoBytes. Apple’s robust security infrastructure safeguards your information against unauthorized access.
    
    User Responsibilities:
    
    • iCloud Account Security: It is your responsibility to maintain the security of your Apple ID and iCloud account. Ensure that you use strong, unique passwords and enable two-factor authentication to protect your data.

    "6. User Rights": """
    You have the right to:

    • Access Your Data: Access the data stored on your device and in your iCloud account through VinoBytes.
    
    • Delete Your Data: Delete your data stored locally on your device and in iCloud by using the reset and delete options in the app’s account settings. This includes resetting your wines, flashcard progress, and conversation history. Deleting data ensures it is removed from both your device and iCloud.
    
    • Data Portability: Request a copy of your data stored in iCloud by contacting us at support@vinobytes.com.
    
    • Rectification: Request corrections to any inaccurate or incomplete data stored on your device or in iCloud.

    "7. Data Retention": """

Apple’s CloudKit also implements rigorous security measures to protect your data during transmission and storage. OpenAI similarly implements security measures to protect data during processing.
    """,
    "9. Consent and Transparency": """
